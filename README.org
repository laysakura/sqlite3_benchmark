  This repository is a template for SQLite benchmark with any SQL.
  You can evaluate many queries at the same time with various parameters like different database files or whether to drop page cache.

* Features
  - *Template system*: You can make many benchmark environments using this repository as a template.
    You can use installation tool to make an environment quickly.
  - *Graph*: It's easy to get various graphs.  You can set /graph-parameter/ and /plot-parameter/
    to specify parameters to split graphs or plots.
  - *Easy configuration*: You can write experimental environments, SQLs, and parameters as you like.
    Only you have to do is to modify these 3 files.
    - python/SQL.py
    - python/Config.py
    - make/Makefile

* Usage
  1. Add install/sqlite-benchmark-install.py into your PATH
  2. Hit sqlite-benchmark-install.py command in an empty directory
     in which you want to construct benchmark environment.
  3. Modify these 3 files to fit your experimental environment.
     - python/SQL.py
     - python/Config.py
     - make/Makefile
  4. Just hit `make' command in make/ directory.
  5. You get graphs in resultsGraph/ directory.
